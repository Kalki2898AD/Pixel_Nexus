            <h1>Forza Horizon 5</h1>
            <p>Forza Horizon 5, developed by Playground Games and released in November 2021, stands as one of the most celebrated racing games of its time, offering a breathtaking blend of high-speed action, open-world exploration, and visual splendor.

The game’s emphasis on freedom, exploration, and community-driven experiences makes it more than just a racing title—it is an open-world adventure where players can immerse themselves in automotive culture.</p>
            <p>At the heart of Forza Horizon 5 is its expansive open world, which is by far the largest and most varied map in the series. The virtual Mexico is a vibrant, living world filled with dynamic weather conditions, seasonal changes, and detailed environments. Players can race through dense forests, climb towering volcanoes, and speed along sandy coastlines, all while experiencing the ever-changing weather, such as tropical storms or heavy rain that alter driving conditions. This open world is not just a backdrop for races but also a playground for exploration, offering players the freedom to drive anywhere they please, discover hidden landmarks, and participate in a variety of challenges.</p>
